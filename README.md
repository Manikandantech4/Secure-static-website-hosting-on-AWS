# Secure-static-website-hosting-on-AWS
Developed and deployed a static portfolio website on AWS using secure and scalable architecture without exposing the S3 bucket to public access.

Key Highlights:

1. Created a responsive static website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. Hosted static content on a private S3 bucket, with CloudFront as a secure content delivery layer using Origin Access Control (OAC).
3. Configured Amazon Route 53 for custom domain routing and DNS management.
4. Enabled HTTPS and SSL certificate via AWS Certificate Manager for secure website access.
